The Common Core of 42 School is the foundational learning period designed to teach students essential programming concepts, problem-solving skills, and critical thinking through hands-on coding challenges. This phase is structured to ensure that all students develop a strong understanding of programming basics and the ability to work independently, which are essential for success in the program. Here's an overview of what it involves:
Key Features:

    Peer-to-Peer Learning:
        Students collaborate and learn from each other, with no traditional teachers or classes. This approach fosters communication, teamwork, and independence.

    Project-Based Learning:
        Students complete a series of increasingly challenging coding projects. Each project builds upon the previous one to deepen understanding.

    Gamified Structure:
        The program uses a gamified system where students earn points, level up, and unlock new projects as they progress.

    Autonomy and Problem Solving:
        Students are expected to solve problems independently, which means researching, debugging, and seeking help from peers when necessary.

    C Programming Language:
        A significant focus is on learning C, which lays the groundwork for understanding low-level programming, memory management, and algorithms.

    Time-Intensive:
        The Common Core is typically an intensive period of 4 to 6 months, requiring significant dedication and effort.

    Evaluation:
        Projects are reviewed and evaluated by peers, fostering a deeper understanding of code quality, logic, and presentation.

Topics Covered:

    Basics of C programming (syntax, variables, loops, and functions)
    Memory management (pointers, arrays, and dynamic allocation)
    Algorithms and data structures (sorting, searching, linked lists, etc.)
    Unix commands and shell scripting
    Version control (Git)
    Problem-solving and debugging techniques

By the end of the Common Core, students are expected to have a strong foundation in programming and the ability to tackle more advanced topics as they move into the specialized areas of the 42 curriculum.
